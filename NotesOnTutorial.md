# Notes on Tutorial

The first tutorial is 1_hello_tensorflow.ipynb. It explains the basics of defining the tensors 
(which is just a generalization of arrays, matrices, with a fancier name), and add/multiply/assign operations on them.

> A vector is a 1-d array and is known as a 1st-order tensor. A matrix is a 2-d array and a 2nd-order tensor.

Some key points:

1. Tensorflow works well with numpy package
1. Tensorflow uses delayed computation (compute it only when you explicitly ask it to)
