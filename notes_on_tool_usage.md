# Tool usage

## Atom Editor
- `Ctrl + Shift + m`: preview markdown (Ctrl, not Command, even on mac)
- `Cmd + Shift + p`: command palette (you can find `git clone` in command palette, which is very handy)
- `Cmd + Shift + :`: correct spelling or add to known words (To enable `add to known words`, see [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/41914650/1316649))
